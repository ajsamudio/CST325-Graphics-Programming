      -I liked the minecraft video explaining light ray tracers, made it easier for me to understand and how rays can bounce
      <br>
      -Felt confused about the homework and the instruction guide aswell.
      <br>
      -One thing I thought for todo-4 we were supposed to have a gradient
      <br>
      -A lot of variables and not sure what each of them do
      <h3>What skills did you improve?</h3>
      -Trignometrey skills are still a bit rough, needs improvement
      <br>
