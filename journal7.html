    <h1>Journal 7 Texturing & Transparency</h1>

      <p>
      This weeks went rather well, we were able to do most todos but got stuck a
      few times and wasn't able to get the texturing down
      <br>
      <img src="img/tnt1.png" height="400px" width="500px">
      <br><br>
      <img src="img/tnt2.png" height="400px" width="500px">
      <br>
      Here is what we got the transparency works even the plane is one view but again
      unsure why the texturing isn't working.
      <br>
      We spent majority of our time trying to debug our and work our way through to-do 4 and 5
      <br>
      Assuming our problem is in webgl-geometry-json.js or webgl-geometry-quad.js or maybe the shaders
      <br>
      Camera also works with pan and zoom
      <br>
      this weeks videos was also helpful but I was looking to relook at last tuesdays lecture
