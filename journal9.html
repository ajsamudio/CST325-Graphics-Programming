    <h1>Journal 9 Shadow Mapping</h1>

      <p>
        My partner and I both had busier schedules this week and which meant we met up less
        <br>
        had a little help from other classmates with the assignment 
        <br>
        Really enjoyed the COD MW PC reference video as a big COD fanboy it really tied in with this weeks content
        <br>
        Ray-traced shadows very technical but makes a huge difference to the game
        <br>
        <img src="img/2060.png" height="275px" width="400px">
        <br>
        Was watching the COD MW vid and they kept mentioning the 2060 GPUS, while i cry with a 960 :(
