    <h1>Journal 5 Intro to WebGL</h1>

      <p>
        This week was rather difficult again. At first we were crusing by the homework and got our first
        stop at the function "createshaders", at first we had the "web-gl-canvas" in the getElement tag
        until we console logged it and saw it was a null and then overlooked at the document as a whole
        and found the right ID tags. We then stumpled upon the problem in the createCompiledShader function
        where our shadersource wasn't working and we thought we tried every combination with the given parameters
        with no luck. Until the next day we retried shader as the first parameter and it worked. Also when
        got to Todo 5 we didn't get a triangle in the canvas instead we got a constant error loop in the console
        "Cannot read property 'vertexPositionAttribute" 
        <br>
        We did end up watching some YT tutorials that were pretty identical to this assignment which helped not only with the syntax
        but understading what each line does and how it works as a whole. The quiz itself was also rather
        hard aswell. I fear for the future of this class for myself but will remain persistent.
