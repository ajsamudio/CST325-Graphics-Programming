    <h1>Journal 6 WebGL2</h1>

      <p>
      This weeks assignment was more graspable and helped us catch-up.
      Over spring break it was hard for us to meet up since we had different schedules
      but we were able to get it done and I reviewed the rasterazation pipeline.<br>

      At first we were having trouble with our file from the start with the fetch
      erorrs and they couldn't grab the shaders.
      <br>
      <img src="img/error.png" height="300px" width="450px">
      <br>
      We fixed this by using a different compiler, replit assuming it was something
      with the root file?
      <br>
      <img src="img/webgl2.gif" height="300px" width="450px">
      <br>
      final product, got the ball to flash yellow white and pink and was able to make the camera move!
