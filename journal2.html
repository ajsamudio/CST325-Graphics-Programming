    <p>
      <h3>What was hard/easy?</h3>
      Ray-intersection (math side)!!
      <br>
      <img src="img/maeth.gif" height="150px" width="300px">
      <br>
      <br>
      <img src="img/fuu.gif" height="150px" width="300px">
      <br>
      Gif's still relevant
      <h3>What did you like/dislike?</h3>
      Learning about ray-intersects was a little difficult (again even though it was hard I liked the challenge)
      <br>
      The video/visual representations of ray-intersects (i.e The unity games like the walking person with the ray pointing at nearby objects
      and the spaceship avoiding meteors)
      <br>
      felt like it put it together for me
      <br>

      <h3>What was surprising or fun?</h3>
      Homework was kind of hard my partner Jonathan and I struggled at first understanding the concept and problem at first
      <br>
      We went to Danny's office hours, which helped as he guided us on what formula we should use and visually explained it to us, but still not understanding 100% of it
      <br>
      Again, making this page was fun
      <br>
      <h3>What skills did you improve?</h3>
      Navigating through folders, was easier since it's like last week and we just implented vector3.js to math folder
      <br>
      Still using atom; hopefully it's fine and I dont need to use VS?
      <br>
      Getting back into the groove of github and html/js
      <br>
      Still unsure how to access my page/homework assignment from git
