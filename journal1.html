      Kinda overloaded and overwhelmed, need to brush up harder on my math and linear algebra
      <br>
      <h3>What was surprising or fun?</h3>
      Homework was kind of hard at the end but my partner Garrett helped a lot and it was fun once I understood it because I like problem-solving
      <br>
